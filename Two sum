#Given an array of integers numsÂ and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#You can return the answer in any order.
#Example Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
#Output: [0,1]
#Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {} # it will be mapping value to the index of that value

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if target - n in seen:
                return(seen[target- n],i)
            elif n not in seen:
                seen[n] = i
